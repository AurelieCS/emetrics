What you need to do: 
- start with the makefile, understand the syntax. No need aftewards to remember how to compile
- study the src directory (source) which contains the raw code
- understand where things go (other directories)
- do "make" (will compile)
- go to runtime directory and execute runmodel
- check that output created
- check out the readsim.do file in the do directory to see how to read a simulated dataset
